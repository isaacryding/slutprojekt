        The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
    The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.
    The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.
    A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.
    Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.
    The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
    The test will begin on the word start.
    On your mark, get ready, start.
